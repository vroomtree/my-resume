        <ol>
            <li>3D Printing
                <ul>
                    <li>I enjoy both resin and FDM 3D printing. I like to print anything from unique characters to useful daily tools.</li>
                    <li>I've also recently started dabbling in Zbrush to create my own designs</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Web Development
                <ul>
                    <li>Clearly still very new to this, hence the entirely html website, but I'm enjoying it thus far!</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Dungeons & Dragons
                <ul>
                    <li>A game where anything is possible, what's not to like? I defintely prefer playing rogue characters & most of my experiece is in version 3.5.</li>
                    <li>This game promotes peer-to-peer engagement, critical thinking & creative problem solving skills, and allows all people involved to hone their communication skills</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
